An example of a donation feature has the following functionalities:

On clicking the "Give Now" button, the donation amount progress bar moves.
On clicking "Tell your friends," a dialog appears with the message "Yay, I donated!"
On clicking "Save for later," a dialog shows up with the message "Saved!"
If an incorrect amount is input:
   - under 1, it should display a dialog with a corresponding message.
   - over 1000, it should display a dialog with a corresponding message.
   - with decimals, it should show a dialog with a corresponding message.
